# Slack Thread Keyword Extraction - Summary

**Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Source**: Slack Thread  
**Project**: Ignite Knowledge

## 📋 Thread Overview

The Slack thread discussed automating keyword extraction from Slack conversations and updating the knowledge base with extracted information.

## 🔑 Extracted Keywords

### Primary Topics
1. **Keyword Extraction** - Automatically identifying key terms and concepts
2. **Automation** - Streamlining the knowledge capture process
3. **Knowledge Base** - Centralized repository for team knowledge
4. **Slack Integration** - Connecting Slack conversations to the knowledge system
5. **Repository Setup** - Configuration of the codebase for processing
6. **AI Processing** - Using AI/NLP for intelligent content analysis

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

1. **Implement automated keyword extraction** - Move from manual to automated extraction
2. **Set up repository integration** - Connect the Ignite Knowledge repo for processing
3. **Update knowledge base automatically** - Enable real-time knowledge capture from threads

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How to extract keywords from Slack threads?**  
A: Use AI/NLP techniques to analyze thread content and identify key topics, decisions, and important information.

**Q: What repository is needed?**

{
  "summary": "Automated Keyword Extraction from Slack Threads for Knowledge Base",
  "topics": [
    "keyword extraction",
    "automation",
    "knowledge base",
    "Slack integration",
    "repository setup",
    "AI processing"
  ],
  "decisions": [
    "Implement automated keyword extraction from Slack threads",
